/*I'm cool with whichever kind of menu thing you wanna use!
//TODO: should this be a SingleFragmentActivity or something else??
/*It depends on whether you want to have the history page be a single fragment with all of its components on one layout or if you
 * want to have multiple fragments, like have one fragment show the chart, and then have a button that says see completed tasks that
  * triggers an intent for a fragment that has a list of the completed tasks. If you have multiple fragments, then it wouldn't be a Single
  * FragmentActivity, so it's really up to you on how you want this section to work.*/
